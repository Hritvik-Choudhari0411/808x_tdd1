## Roles:

**Part 1:**
- Mudit Singal (Driver)
- Hritvik Choudhari (Navigator)

**Part 2:**
- Patrik Dominik Pordi (Driver)
- Kiran S Patil (Navigator)



Steps followed:
Part 1:
* The driver cloned the repo cpp-boilerplate-v2
* A new library for implementation of PID controller was created in the _libs_ folder
* An empty class implementation was created that had private member variables and public member functions (methods) with appropriate constructor and compute method.
* The code was pushed to the git repo
* This implementation was then cloned by the navigator
* The navigator added test cases and ran the test cases as per the guidelines of assignment

Part 2:
* The roles are reversed.
* The new driver now implements the incomplete methods
* The new navigator makes new test cases as per the implemented methods
* The navigator runs the test cases and pushes the code

To do:
* Code analysis and code review (necessary for deployment cases)
