{\bfseries{Part 1\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mudit Singal (Driver)
\item Hritvik Choudhari (Navigator)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Part 2\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Patrik Dominik Pordi (Driver)
\item Kiran S Patil (Navigator)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Steps followed\+: Part 1\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The driver cloned the repo cpp-\/boilerplate-\/v2
\item A new library for implementation of P\+ID controller was created in the {\itshape libs} folder
\item An empty class implementation was created that had private member variables and public member functions (methods) with appropriate constructor and compute method.
\item The code was pushed to the git repo
\item This implementation was then cloned by the navigator
\item The navigator added test cases and ran the test cases as per the guidelines of assignment
\end{DoxyItemize}

Part 2\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The roles are reversed.
\item The new driver now implements the incomplete methods
\item The new navigator makes new test cases as per the implemented methods
\item The navigator runs the test cases and pushes the code
\end{DoxyItemize}

Instructions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Navigate to the workspace
\item Delete build folder if exist\+: rm -\/rf build
\item Generate build\+: cmake -\/S ./ -\/B build/
\item Build the project\+: cmake --build build/ --clean-\/first
\item Run the testcase\+: build/test/cpp-\/test 
\end{DoxyItemize}
